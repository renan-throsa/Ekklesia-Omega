### Angular SPA and ASP.NET API

This small app is designed to showcase what I've learned from the first project that I worked on. This app manages a small church and its affairs. It features an ASP Net core back end and an Angular front end.

Up until now, it has support for crud operations for members and transactions.

### Requirements 

This app needs net6.0 and node 14 to run locally. But I recommend getting this up and running by typing:

```
docker compose up
```

Finally, head to:

```
http://localhost:4003/
```
